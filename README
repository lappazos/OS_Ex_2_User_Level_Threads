FILES:
README -- details + questions
uthreads.cpp -- provides functions to maintain threads
Makefile -- for the command make creates the library libuthreads.a

REMARKS:
Learned a lot :)

ANSWERS:

Question 1:
user-level threads package can be implemented on an operating system that does not support threads.
All operating systems used to fall into this category, and even now some still do.

Question 2:
The advantages of creating new process and not kernel lavel threads - threads has no protection
between themselves, and all threads can access every address in the task. threads are not
independent of one another.
disadvantages of creating new process and not kernel lavel threads - Because threads can share
common data, they do not need to use interprocess communication. also, They only need a stack and
storage for registers therefore, threads are cheap to create

Question 3:
Keyboard sends interrupts that writes the command in shell. shell command call kill() system call
that sends SIGKILL/SIGTERM (SIGTERM can be handleld by a
handler, against SIGKILL) to the process according to its ID.

Question 4:
Virtual time decrements only when the process is executing, and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration.
needed for thread designing.
real time decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon expiration. needed for clock
applications.
